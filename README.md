NT-Surgery-Plus-Ultra-name-pending

To use this version instead of the updated version, download the code by clicking the green " < > Code â–¼ " button to the top right of the folder list,
Then click download ZIP.

While thats downloading go to your steam library, find barotrauma in your library and right click it, go to manage, then click on browse local files,
Then locate the folder called LocalMods, extract the folder from the ZIP file downloaded before and put it in the LocalMods folder

If your barotrauma game is open, reload your mod list, if the mod dosent show up restart the game
You should have a mod with the same name as normal, but with a grey pencil icon next to it, use that instead of the usual mod.

Best of luck :)
