NT-Surgery-Plus-Ultra-name-pending

To use this version instead of the updated version, download the mod by finding the releases section on the right hand side of the page,
specifically the release called "Pre Neurotrauma dependancy change", click on either the zip or tar.gz links

While thats downloading go to your steam library, find barotrauma in your library and right click it, go to manage, then click on browse local files,
Then locate the folder called LocalMods, extract the folder from the file downloaded before and put it in the LocalMods folder 
-- 7zip works if you dont otherwise have the ability to extract the file.

If your barotrauma game is open, reload your mod list, if the mod dosent show up restart the game
You should have a mod with the same name as normal, but with a grey pencil icon next to it, use that instead of the usual mod.

Best of luck :)
