(make default organ storage item 2 slots, then the upgrade for the container/crate)
-- Tier 1 --
~Fine bedside manner~* **(Added)** w/(trippled range)
(Change it so 'next to' gives a decaying debuff over X seconds, and giving meds provides a longer less effective buff)
(X is hard, needs to be high enough to not sit next to people and be bored, but low enough it isn't a free buff)
(could also make AOE larger, probably the easiest and most efficient implementation - not as fun though)

The effect is soubled if they are laying in a bed.
Whenever you finish a mission without a cremember dying, 
you gain an additional 40% exp and gain the item 'Medical Misconduct (surgeon skillbook)'
Assistant deaths dont count (pretty sure this is bugged for surgeon though)


-- Tier 2 -- **(Added)**
~Fish are specimens, not food~ (lowered from medic chance)
(add check to see if there are others with this skill to make it so you dont get 50 genetics per monster?)
(or perhaps make it work alongside the currect genetics stuff to give a higher tier on refinement?)

your submarine, you have a 30% (currently 35%) chance of finding a random 
genetic material on it.

Gain the pill cannister and pill box recipes
Medical items you apply gain an additional 20% potency
